This Game Jam was an occasion to learn Phaser 3, and to produce all my assets myself as is recommended for Ludum Dare. I recorded and produced the entirety of the sound effects and music for this game!

## Technical challenge
On top of being completely new to Phaser 3, I took ahead the big challenge of implementing a system that allows to move around paper sheets on top of each other in 2D. It's hard to describe, but you can try it for yourself by playing the game. It was challenging to play with rendering order of objects in my scene but I managed to make a system that works seemlessly.

## Time constraint
Since this is Ludum Dare, there are 3 formats:
- The Compo (solo, 48 hours, open-source, from scratch)
- The Jam (solo or in teams, 72 hours, mostly from scratch)
- Extra (solo or in teams, 3 weeks, mostly from scratch)

I originally aimed for The Compo, since I made all the sounds and music myself, but decided to opt for The Jam to keep my sanity and since I had a lot of content to produce (a narative, the class notes and the questions).

Enjoy browsing the code and playing!
